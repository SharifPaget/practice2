</p>
        <p>One of the biggest risks in the economy now is momentum — the possibility that the stock market, the labor market, the inflation rate and the unemployment rate could all overshoot, says Jim O’Sullivan, the chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics and the three-peat winner of MarketWatch’s Forecaster of the Month contest.
</p>
        <p>While everyone is focused on the level of things — the Dow at 25,000, the unemployment rate at 4.1%, core inflation at 1.5% — “it’s the trajectory that matters,” O’Sullivan said in a phone interview. “It’s possible that we could sustain a 4.1% unemployment rate — maybe — but it’s still falling.”
</p>
        <p>The Fed hopes to blunt the momentum of growth without crashing the economy.
</p>
        <p>O’Sullivan wonders what would happen if the unemployment rate sinks to 3.5%, as he expects it to by the end of the year. “What does that mean for inflation and the Fed?”
</p>
        <p>“All the trends point to the unemployment rate falling,” he said. “There’s no sign of employment slowing.” O’Sullivan’s forecasting model uses a version of the NAIRU theory — which stands for the “non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.” Under this theory, inflation will accelerate if the unemployment rate falls and stays below the NAIRU rate. Most estimates of NAIRU put it between 4.5% and 5%.
